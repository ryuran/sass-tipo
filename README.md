# Sass‑Tipo


##Manage typographic rules

* __Vertical rythm:__ keep line height in the rythm
* __Typographic scale:__ coherent font-size


##Pixel in code but better in live

Keep `px` to communicate with “Creative people”.

All variables of config and in your code are defined `px`.

Use function of Sass-Tipo to convert `px` to other unit (`rem` is adviced).

##Other
If you choose `rem` don’t forget old Internet Explorer. Use a post processor.

##Thanks
